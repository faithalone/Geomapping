# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize from a JSON representation of that data. This script will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization by creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers will reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color. In addition, popups will be included to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
